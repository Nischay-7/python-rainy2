Create your very first function that prints a classic greeting to the console.


## Task Description

Your task is to implement a function called `hello_world()` in the file `project/hello_world.py`. 

This function should print exactly "Hello, World!" (including the comma and exclamation mark) to the console when called.

## Hints

- Remember that `print()` is a built-in Python function
- Make sure your string is enclosed in quotes (either single `'` or double `"`)
- The output should be exactly as specified - check for proper capitalization, punctuation, and spacing


Good luck, and happy coding! 🚀

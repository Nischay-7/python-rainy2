Stage 1: Indentation Essentials - Understanding Python's Code Structure

Learn how Python's interpreter works and master the critical role of indentation in Python code.


FIRST PRINCIPLES FIRST!


THE PYTHON INTERPRETER

Python is an interpreted language.

This means that Python code is not converted into an executable first. Instead, another program called an Interpreter reads the code and executes it step by step.

This is exactly what happens:

1. Python compiles your code to bytecode (.pyc files).
2. The bytecode is interpreted and executed instruction by instruction.

So, Python is bytecode-compiled but interpreted at runtime.

Bytecode is set of low-level instructions meant for the Python interpreter, not for the CPU.

This comes with its pros and cons.

Pros:
- No compilation → faster development.
- Easier debugging.
- Highly portable - same .py file can run anywhere with Python installed.

Cons:
- Slower execution compared to compiled languages.
- Errors appear only when faulty line is reached.

Python source code is stored in file with .py suffix.


INDENTATION

In Python, indentation is how you tell what code belongs together. Indentation simply means using of tabs or spaces to group code. Other languages use { } braces.

Example:

if True:
    print("This runs")
    print("This also runs")

Both print lines run because they are indented i.e grouped under the if.

If you remove indentation:

if True:
print("This causes an error")

Python gets confused and throws error.

Where indentation is used:
- inside if, else, elif blocks
- inside for and while loops
- inside functions
- inside classes

So remember this important rule → all lines in the same block must have the same indentation level.


TASK DESCRIPTION

Your task is to fix indentation errors in several functions and complete one function.

Open the file project/code_structure.py and follow the TODO comments.

Task 1: Fix the indentation in check_grade() function (if/elif/else blocks)
- This function should return a grade based on the score
- Should return "A" for score >= 90
- Should return "B" for score >= 80
- Should return "C" for score >= 70
- Should return "F" otherwise
- Fix the indentation errors in the if/elif/else blocks so the return statements are properly indented

Task 2: Fix the indentation in print_numbers() function (for loop)
- This function should print numbers from 1 to n (inclusive)
- Fix the indentation error in the for loop so the print statement is properly indented inside the loop

Task 3: Fix the indentation in countdown() function (while loop)
- This function should print a countdown from start to 1, then print "Blast off!"
- Fix the indentation errors in the while loop so the print and assignment statements are properly indented inside the loop
- Note: "Blast off!" should print after the while loop completes (not inside the loop)

Task 4: Complete the is_even() function by adding the if/else logic with correct indentation
- This function should return True if number is even, False otherwise
- A number is even if it is divisible by 2 (number % 2 == 0)
- Add the if/else logic with correct indentation inside the function
- Hint: Check if number % 2 == 0, return True if yes, False otherwise

This will help you understand how Python uses indentation to structure code.


HINTS

- All code inside an if/elif/else block must be indented (usually 4 spaces)
- All code inside a for loop must be indented
- All code inside a while loop must be indented
- All code inside a function must be indented (except the function definition line)
- Use consistent indentation (spaces or tabs, but not both)
- Python standard is 4 spaces per indentation level
- Check that your code runs without IndentationError

Good luck!
